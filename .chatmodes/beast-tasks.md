# Beast Mode Tasks

## Phase 1: UNDERSTAND & PLAN
- [✓] Check upgrade-guide.md for context
- [✓] Read project structure and source files
- [✓] Research position.json configuration format
- [✓] Plan comprehensive source code review

## Phase 2: IMPLEMENT SOLUTION
- [✓] Analyze current position.json configuration handling
- [✓] Review all visual property implementations (layout, positioning, colors, images, gradients, strokes)

## Phase 4: SIMPLIFICATION PLAN
- [✓] Develop simplified approach for 100% coverage
- [✓] Focus on React Native compatibility
- [✓] Prioritize code clarity and maintainability
- [✓] Design clean component architecture
- [✓] Base plan on actual position.json format (no invented features)
- [✓] Create realistic implementation timeline

## Phase 5: IMPLEMENTATION
- [✓] Consolidate multiple component files into single QuestlineViewer
- [✓] Remove complex utility abstractions
- [✓] Implement direct positioning calculations
- [✓] Add simple state management for all components
- [✓] Create cross-platform compatible utilities
- [✓] Implement gradient CSS conversion
- [✓] Add shadow support with scaling
