# Beast Mode PRD - 100% Coverage Enhancement Plan

## Problem & Users (JTBD)
**Problem**: Current implementation achieves 85% overall coverage of position.json configuration options. Need to reach 100% coverage across all categories, with special emphasis on performance optimization.

**Users**:
- Developers implementing questline features who need comprehensive configuration support
- End users requiring optimal performance and accessibility
- Designers needing complete visual fidelity from Figma exports

**Jobs to be Done**:
- Achieve 100% coverage of all visual configuration options
- Optimize performance to handle large questlines efficiently
- Implement complete accessibility support
- Provide advanced animation and interaction capabilities

## Goals/Success
- **Typography**: 85% → 100% coverage with custom fonts, advanced text properties
- **Layout Properties**: 80% → 100% with full auto-layout and grid systems
- **Animations**: 60% → 100% with spring animations and custom easing
- **Accessibility**: 40% → 100% with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: 70% → 100% with optimization for large datasets
- **Advanced Visual Effects**: 90% → 100% with complete effect library

## Scope

### In Scope
- Complete implementation of missing configuration options
- Performance optimization for large questlines (100+ quests)
- Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Advanced animation system with spring physics
- Custom font loading and typography enhancements
- Memory management and asset optimization
- Advanced visual effects (inner shadows, blend modes, filters)
- Developer experience improvements

### Out of Scope
- Breaking changes to existing API
- Platform-specific native implementations
- Server-side rendering optimizations
- Third-party integrations beyond web fonts

## Functional Requirements

### Performance Optimization (Priority 1)
- Implement virtual scrolling for large questlines
- Add progressive image loading with WebP/AVIF support
- Implement efficient state management with memoization
- Add worker-based asset processing
- Implement intelligent caching strategies

### Typography Enhancement (Priority 2)
- Add custom web font loading with fallbacks
- Implement advanced text properties (letter-spacing, line-height)
- Add text shadow and decoration support
- Implement responsive typography scaling

### Animation System (Priority 2)
- Build spring-based animation framework
- Add custom easing functions and timing
- Implement complex state transition animations
- Add gesture-based interactions

### Accessibility Implementation (Priority 3)
- Add complete ARIA label support
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add screen reader compatibility
- Implement focus management
- Add high contrast mode support

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle 100+ quests with <16ms frame times
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Memory**: Efficient asset management with <100MB memory usage
- **Compatibility**: Support modern browsers (ES2020+)
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with <10% performance overhead

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Performance**: Sub-100ms initial load times for typical questlines
2. **Coverage**: 100% support for all position.json configuration options
3. **Accessibility**: Full screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
4. **Visual Fidelity**: Pixel-perfect reproduction of Figma designs
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs and comprehensive TypeScript types
