# Beast Mode PRD

## Problem & Users
**Problem**: Current doc.md may not provide sufficient context and architectural guidance for LLM coding agents to effectively understand and modify the questline component system.

**Users**: LLM coding agents tasked with:
- Adding new functionality to questline components
- Fixing bugs in the React TypeScript codebase
- Understanding state management patterns
- Modifying component renderers and interactions

## Goals & Success Criteria
**Primary Goal**: Create comprehensive, LLM-agent optimized documentation that enables autonomous code changes

**Success Metrics**:
- LLM agents can understand component architecture without additional context requests
- Clear guidance on state management patterns and component relationships
- Specific coding conventions and patterns documented
- Testing and build processes clearly explained

## Scope

### In Scope
- Complete architectural overview
- State management patterns and flows
- Component structure and relationships
- Code conventions and standards
- Testing strategy and patterns
- Build and deployment processes
- Common modification patterns

### Out of Scope
- End-user documentation
- Marketing or business context
- Detailed API reference (covered by TypeScript types)

## Functional Requirements
- Clear component hierarchy documentation
- State flow diagrams/explanations
- Code pattern examples
- Testing guidance
- File organization principles

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Documentation should be scannable by LLM agents (< 4000 tokens)
- **Clarity**: Each section should be self-contained and actionable
- **Specificity**: Include concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Document covers all major architectural components
2. ✅ State management patterns are clearly explained
3. ✅ Component relationships are documented
4. ✅ Testing patterns and conventions are included
5. ✅ File organization and naming conventions are clear
6. ✅ Common modification patterns are documented
