# Beast Mode Knowledge

## Assumptions
- Position.json is part of the ZIP file structure imported for questline preview
- Configuration covers visual properties for quest rendering
- Current implementation covers basic component rendering but may miss advanced properties

## Decisions
- Focus on visual configuration properties (layout, positioning, colors, images, gradients, strokes)
- Review both current implementation and potential gaps
- Prioritize missing features that affect visual fidelity

## Context Notes
- Project uses React/TypeScript for questline viewer with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- ZIP files contain quest assets and position.json configuration
- Current implementation supports: Quests, Timer, Header, Rewards, Button components
- State management through React Context with cycling interactions
- Responsive scaling and positioning utilities implemented

## Key Findings from Source Review
- **Comprehensive Types**: All major configuration options are defined in types.ts
- **Position Utils**: Advanced utilities for scaling, positioning, gradients, shadows
- **Component Renderers**: Full implementation for all component types
- **State Management**: Complete state cycling and interaction handling
- **Asset Loading**: ZIP extraction and blob URL management

## Potential Gaps Identified
- Some advanced styling properties may not be fully utilized
- Complex animations or transitions not implemented
- Advanced layout properties (auto-layout specifics)
- Some Figma-specific features may not translate to web perfectly

## Sources/Links
- upgrade-guide.md (comprehensive format documentation)
- Source code in /src directory (full implementation)
- TypeScript interfaces define complete schema
