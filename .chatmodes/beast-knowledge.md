# Beast Mode Knowledge

## Core Understanding
- This is a React TypeScript questline component demo/library
- State-driven UI with complex interactive components
- Uses hooks pattern for state management (useQuestlineState)
- Component-based architecture with renderers pattern

## Key Decisions
- Centralized state management through custom hook (confidence: high)
- TypeScript for type safety across questline components (confidence: high)
- Component renderer pattern for modularity (confidence: high)
- Testing strategy includes unit, integration, and performance tests (confidence: high)

## Context Notes
- Project has substantial test coverage (coverage/ directory exists)
- Uses Jest for testing framework
- Has build pipeline with example exports
- Focus on questline/gamification UI components
- State cycling is core functionality (locked→active→unclaimed→completed)

## Sources
- Project structure analysis
- useQuestlineState.ts examination
- Package.json and build artifacts review
